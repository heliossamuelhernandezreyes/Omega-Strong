# Omega Framework — Research Roadmap

This repository is part of the broader **Omega Framework**, a classical
scalar–tensor approach to gravity based on geometric saturation mechanisms.

This document outlines the current status and planned research directions.

## Current Status — Omega-Strong (Completed)

✔ Closed and self-consistent strong-field regime  
✔ Geometric curvature saturation implemented  
✔ Regular strong-field core with finite curvature  
✔ Numerical solutions confirming geometric control of the transition scale  
✔ Independence from scalar mass scale verified  

Omega-Strong v1 is considered **theoretically complete** as a proof of concept.

## Next Stage — Omega-UV (In Preparation)

**Objective:**  
Explore ultraviolet completion and high-curvature behavior beyond the
effective Omega-Strong regime.

Planned investigations:
- UV behavior of the saturation function
- Consistency with classical stability bounds
- Possible connections to asymptotic safety–like behavior
- Limits of classical validity

Status: *Conceptual development*

## Cosmological Sector — Omega-CDM (Completed)

✔ Background expansion consistent with ΛCDM  
✔ Linear growth, fσ₈, and γ validated  
✔ Stability conditions (Qs > 0, cₛ² > 0) satisfied  
✔ No scale-dependent deviations at linear order  

Omega-CDM provides the **large-scale complement** to Omega-Strong.

## Future Directions

- Unification of Omega-CDM and Omega-Strong into a single effective action
- Exploration of compact objects and phenomenology
- Comparison with Horndeski / beyond-Horndeski frameworks
- Preparation of consolidated manuscript(s)

## Long-Term Goal

To establish the Omega Framework as a coherent classical alternative
for addressing:
- Cosmological acceleration
- Strong-field regularization
- Scale-dependent gravitational behavior

without invoking exotic matter or quantum gravity assumptions.
